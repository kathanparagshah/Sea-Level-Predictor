# Sea Level Predictor

This is the Sea Level Predictor project that analyzes global average sea level change since 1880 and predicts sea level changes through 2050.

## Description
This project uses pandas, matplotlib, and scipy to:
- Import and analyze EPA sea level data
- Create scatter plots of sea level changes over time
- Generate two lines of best fit (1880-2013 and 2000-2013)
- Predict sea level rise through 2050
